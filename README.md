Local:
========

and here is a link to the active build (under construction): http://jswars.com/

Gameplay:
========

The enter key selects a unit or building,

at this point only infantry can be built and are represented by blue dots, you can build infantry using the base which is represented by a blue square, the headquarters is a purple square

The escape key will escape out of any menu in the game and if pressed while no unit or building is selected it will bring up the options menu, you may end your turn by selecting end from the options menu

The co status hud ( rounded hud on the top of the screen ) displays the amount of gold there is to spend on units

Units are moved by selecting them, moving the cursor to the desired location within the highlighted movement range and then pressing enter again
