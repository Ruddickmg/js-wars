Gameplay:
========

The enter key selects a unit or building,

at this point only infantry can be built and are represented by blue dots, you can build infantry using the base which is represented by a blue square, the headquarters is a purple square

The escape key will escape out of any menu in the game and if pressed while no unit or building is selected it will bring up the options menu, you may end your turn by selecting end from the options menu

Units are moved by selecting them, moving the cursor to the desired location within the highlighted movement range and then pressing enter again

at least two players are needed to start a game, there is still some work to be done coordinating menu's etc, so game creation and joining may be buggy under certain circumstances

the game is not yet animated, more units will be available as they are become animated
